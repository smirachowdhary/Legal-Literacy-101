# Legal-Literacy-101
Legal Literacy 101 exists to make the law clear, accessible, and usable. Our mission is to provide plain-language, multilingual legal information so immigrants, workers, and students understand their rights and feel empowered to advocate for themselves. We believe access to legal knowledge should not depend on income, language, or background.
