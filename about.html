        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
          We provide plain-language, multilingual legal information so immigrants, workers, and students
          understand their rights and feel empowered to advocate for themselves. We believe that access
          to legal knowledge should not depend on income, language, or background. Everyone deserves to
          understand the rules that affect their lives.
