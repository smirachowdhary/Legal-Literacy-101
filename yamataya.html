    <p>
      One of the steps taken in order to ensure due process in deportations is a deportation hearing, which determines whether an individual is violating immigration laws by being in the United States. But is there a difference between a deportation hearing and a regular court hearing?
    </p>

    <p>
      Some characteristics are shared between the two to ensure a functioning courtroom, such as a judge responsible for determining the final verdict and a prosecutor presenting an opposing argument. Both courtrooms are open to the public. However, this is where the major similarities end.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key distinction can be understood through the Supreme Court case <em>Yamataya v. Fisher</em>, 189 U.S. 86 (1903), also known as <em>The Japanese Immigrant Case</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      On July 11, 1901, Kaoru Yamataya, a Japanese citizen, arrived in Seattle, Washington. Shortly afterward, she was detained on suspicion of becoming a “public charge,” meaning someone likely to become primarily dependent on government support. She was ordered to be deported. Yamataya argued that she was not informed of the investigation and was denied due process under the Fifth Amendment. She also argued that the hearing was conducted in English, a language she did not speak. After a series of appeals, the case reached the Supreme Court.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Supreme Court ruled that due process was not violated. The Court reasoned that procedural standards had been met and that her inability to understand English did not automatically make the hearing fundamentally unfair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Importantly, the Court established that while judges may review whether a deportation hearing was conducted fairly, they generally will not reassess the government’s decision to deport. In contrast, criminal courts can review and overturn guilty verdicts in misdemeanor or felony cases. Deportation proceedings are considered civil rather than criminal, which limits judicial review.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding this distinction is essential to recognizing how immigration law operates and what rights individuals can realistically expect during the deportation process.
